    <h3>
        Welcome
    </h3>

    <p>
        Thank you for participating in this decision-making activity. Your show-up fee is <strong>{{ sufee }}</strong>. 
        In this activity, you have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant. One of you was selected at 
        random to be <strong>First Person</strong>; the other to be <strong>Second Person</strong>. You will learn whether you are 
        First or Second Person prior to making any decision. During this activity you will be able to earn more money based on 
        the decisions of both you and your partner. Here we will be using points to compute your final payout, based on an <strong> 
        exchange rate of {{ erpoint|c }} equivalent to $1</strong>. At the end of the activity, you will be privately paid in cash based
        on your and your partner's decisions. Please read the instructions carefully so you understand how your payout is determined. 
        Please turn off your mobile phone and do not talk to the other participants. If you have a question at any moment,
        please raise your hand and a facilitator will answer them privately.
        Next, you will be shown how the payoffs are determined and then given a quiz to test your understanding. 
        Afterward, you will do a trial of the activity with a bot that will not affect your final payout.
        Then, you will proceed to the activity for the actual round with the other participant. Finally you will answer 
        some individual questions.
    </p>
