        You have been randomly assigned the role of <strong>First Person</strong>, while the other player is Second Person. You will see a figure like the
        one below during the activity. The figure will help you to see the possible outcomes of the two-person scenario based on your and the other participant’s
        decisions. You and the other participant randomly matched with you can send messages to each other before making your final decisions. These messages
        can only have this form: “I choose #”, “I choose @,”, or you can ask the other player to reveal information since the symbols on the figure 
        above are different between both of you.

        When you choose <strong>#</strong> in Figure 1, then the following can happen:
        <ol>
            <li>If Second Person chooses left (something you will not know) which in your figure amounts to #, then both of you will receive <strong>10 points</strong> each.</li>
            <li>If Second Person chooses right (something you will not know) which in your figure amounts to @, then you will receive <strong>70 points</strong> and Second Person will receive <strong>20 points</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        On the other hand, when you choose when you choose @, then the following can happen:
        <ol>
            <li>If Second Person chooses left (something you will not know) which in your figure amounts to #, then you will receive <strong>20 points</strong> and Second Person will receive <strong>70 points</strong>.</li>
            <li>If Second Person chooses right (something you will not know) which in your figure amounts to @, then you will both receive <strong>40 points</strong> each.</li>
        </ol>
