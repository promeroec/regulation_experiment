        <b>Welcome to the experiment.</b> You are about to participate in an experiment on decision making.
        Throughout the experiment you must not communicate with other participants.
        If you follow these instructions carefully, you could earn a considerable amount of money. </p>
    <p>You will earn money by completing a task.
        You will be asked to work on a computerized ball-catching task under 4 settings and each setting has 5 periods.
        Each period lasts one minute. In each period, there will be a task box in the middle of your browser like the one shown below:</p>

    <div id="inst_img">
        <img src="{% static "ball_catch/images/instruction.png" %}" width="600"/>
    </div>

    <p>Once you click on the <b>“Start the Task!”</b> button,
        the timer will start and balls will fall randomly from the top of the task box.
        You can move the tray at the bottom of the task box to catch the balls
        by using the mouse to click on the <b>LEFT</b> or <b>RIGHT</b> buttons. To catch a ball,
        your tray must be below the ball before it touches the bottom of the tray.
        When the ball touches the tray your catches increase by one.</p>

    <p>You will receive a prize (in ECU) for each ball you catch.
        In each period, the number of balls you caught so far (displayed as CATCHES),
        and your accumulated prizes so far (SCORE) are shown right above the task box.
        SCORE will be CATCH multiplied by your prize per catch for the period.
        At the end of the period your earnings in ECU for the period will be your SCORE. </p>

    <p>At the end of the experiment, total 4 periods, 1 period for each setting,
        will be randomly selected and the total score of the 4 periods will be converted to Euros
        at the rate of <mark><b>400 ECU = 1 Euro</b></mark>. You will be paid this amount.</p>

    <p><strong>If you are ready, please click the "Next" button. Then the task will start.</strong></p>
